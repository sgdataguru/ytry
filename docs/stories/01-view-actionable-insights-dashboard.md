# User Story: 01 - View Actionable Insights Dashboard

**As a** business leader,
**I want** to view a dashboard that provides actionable direction instead of just raw data visualizations,
**so that** I can make informed decisions quickly without spending time interpreting complex metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Dashboard displays prioritized recommendations based on current business data
* Each insight includes a clear action item with expected impact
* Insights are categorized by urgency (immediate, short-term, strategic)
* User can drill down into the data supporting each recommendation
* Dashboard updates in real-time as new data becomes available

## Notes

* Referenced from: "For leaders who don't want dashboards — they want direction."
* Focus on outcomes over vanity metrics
* Aligns with "Data gives us clarity" philosophy
