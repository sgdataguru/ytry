# User Story: 03 - Run Rapid Experiments

**As a** product manager,
**I want** to quickly set up and run experiments on new ideas,
**so that** I can validate hypotheses fast and iterate based on real-world feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

* User can create an experiment with defined hypothesis and success metrics
* Experiment can be launched within minutes, not days
* Real-time results tracking is available during experiment runtime
* System automatically flags statistical significance when reached
* Failed experiments provide actionable learnings for next iteration

## Notes

* Referenced from: "Try fast. Learn faster. Scale what works."
* Emphasizes speed of learning over perfection
* Cloud infrastructure enables rapid deployment
