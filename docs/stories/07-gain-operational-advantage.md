# User Story: 07 - Gain Operational Advantage

**As an** operations analyst,
**I want** to identify and act on operational inefficiencies automatically,
**so that** I can continuously optimize processes and maintain competitive advantage.

## Acceptance Criteria

* System continuously monitors operational metrics for anomalies
* Inefficiencies are detected and surfaced with root cause analysis
* Recommended optimizations include estimated time/cost savings
* User can implement approved optimizations with minimal manual effort
* Before/after metrics demonstrate realized improvements

## Notes

* Referenced from: "intelligent systems that accelerate outcomes — whether that's... operational advantage"
* Proactive, not reactive approach to operations
* Cloud speed enables real-time monitoring and response
