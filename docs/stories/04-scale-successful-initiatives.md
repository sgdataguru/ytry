# User Story: 04 - Scale Successful Initiatives

**As an** operations manager,
**I want** to easily scale initiatives that have proven successful in experiments,
**so that** I can maximize the impact of winning strategies across the organization.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Successful experiments are flagged with a "ready to scale" indicator
* One-click scaling option available for validated initiatives
* System provides estimated resource requirements for scaling
* Progress tracking shows rollout status across teams/regions
* Rollback capability if scaled initiative underperforms

## Notes

* Referenced from: "Try fast. Learn faster. Scale what works."
* Cloud infrastructure enables elastic scaling
* Focus on amplifying what's already proven
