# User Story: 10 - Onboard to Innovation Platform

**As a** new organization user,
**I want** a guided onboarding experience that connects my data sources and configures AI models,
**so that** I can start gaining insights and running experiments quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Step-by-step onboarding wizard guides initial setup
* Common data source integrations are available (databases, APIs, SaaS tools)
* AI models are pre-configured with sensible defaults for user's industry
* User can complete basic setup within 30 minutes
* Quick-start templates help users run their first experiment immediately

## Notes

* Referenced from: "Cloud gives us speed" and "Why not — and how fast can we make it real?"
* Removes friction to getting started
* For "organisations that refuse to stand still" — they need to move fast
